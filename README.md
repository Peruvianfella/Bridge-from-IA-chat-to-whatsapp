# Bridge-from-IA-chat-to-whatsapp
I want to connect whatsapp to a IA chat such as Chatgpt or Bing AI so that I can chat with it and ask the bot to write and search the internet to get an aswer. In other words I want a free IA browser as a contact that does not require third parties apps or programs.
