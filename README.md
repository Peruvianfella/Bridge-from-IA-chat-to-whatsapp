# Bridge-from-IA-chat-to-whatsapp
I want to connect whatsapp to a IA chat such as Chatgpt or Bing AI so that I can chat with it and ask the bot to write and search the internet to get an aswer. In other words I want a free IA browser as a contact that does not require third parties apps or programs.
I have 0 experience in programming, I just want help to create such bot because I could help people that can't afford to pay their phone internet connection service.
Almost every internet provider gives you 30-60 days of unlimited access to whatsapp in Per√∫ by less than 1 dolar, but a monthly "plan" or suscription costs 20-to 25 dollars.
